### Team Members: Ricardo Herrera, Eugene Witherspoon, Feipeng Yang, Jenny(Yijuan) Yang


Although COVID-19 vaccination may be a controversial topic, it remains a public health priority among many health entities at the federal, state and and local level.

Our analysis explores whether vaccination rates vary significantly within several different populations including those with varying levels of socio-health conditions, socio-economic status, education and political party affiliation. 

The analysis checks correlation between vaccination rates with 170+ factors within above mentioned areas and deep dives into a few picked ones with linear regression and hypothesis tests.

Two notebooks included:
1) Data Cleaning Notebook - for data cleaning and datasets merging
2) Factor Impact Vaccination - for analysis (linear regression and hypothesis tests)
