## Team 9 project 1- Factors Affecting Covid-19 Vaccination: Data Analysis by US County

Although COVID-19 vaccination may be a controversial topic, it remains a public health priority among many health entities at the federal, state and and local level.

Our analysis explores whether vaccination rates vary significantly within several different populations including those with varying levels of socio economic status, education and political party affiliation. 

There are two notebooks:
1) Data Cleaning Notebook - for data cleaning and merging
2) Factor Impact Vaccination - for analysis (linear regression and hypothesis tests)
